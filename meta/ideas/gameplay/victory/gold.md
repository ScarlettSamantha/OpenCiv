# Gold

This could tie into the corporation mechanic, allowing players to buy control of all the world's resources to achieve victory. It might require the corporate government culture tree, integrating it tightly, but also allowing other governments to pursue this win condition.

Should we include a debt mechanic in the game? Perhaps we could implement a system where players can loan gold to others with interest. We could also introduce a non-player faction controlling a central bank, similar to the Iron Bank of Braavos from Game of Thrones. This bank could be established through a wonder, giving the builder significant loan discounts, but still accessible to all players.

Additionally, this bank could set up branches in other players' cities if "invited" (for a fee, of course). Eventually, players might even be able to buy out other cities or civilizations.
