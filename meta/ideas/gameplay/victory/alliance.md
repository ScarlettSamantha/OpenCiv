# Alliance Win Condition

I think it would be fun to have a win condition that lets the player's civilization finish alongside other civilizations while still involving some warfare. In the endgame, since there's typically a lot of war anyway, we can focus on the ideologies of the civilizations, making certain players better allies than others through stats and mutual interests. For example, a puritan and a slaving civilization could cooperate, but it might lead to population unhappiness.

This ending could be similar to forming a "Federation of Planets" like in Star Trek or a modern-day EU. Joining a faction and becoming its leader twice in a row could be an exciting goal. Adding some political elements, such as consensus building through votes and occasionally voting against your own interests, might also be engaging.
