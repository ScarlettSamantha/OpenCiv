# Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This is a personal project that I work on in my free time. While I plan to make regular progress, the focus is more on enjoying the process rather than rapid development.

Thereâ€™s a lot of work ahead, from developing gameplay mechanics to building systems from scratch. I have a vision for where the project is headed, but I'm definitely open to other people's ideas and creativity. Ultimately, where this project ends up will be decided by whatâ€™s the most fun. That said, itâ€™s important to keep the overall vision in mind as we move forward. You can find the detailed project vision in the [vision.md](meta/vision.md) file located in the `meta` directory.

I appreciate any contributions, whether it's code, ideas, or feedback. Good communication will be key as we work together, especially as the project evolves. If you have questions or ideas, feel free to reach out via email (you can find the email by running `git log --reverse --format="%an <%ae>" | head -n 1`) or on Discord.

When contributing code, please follow standard practices like PEP 8, use strict typing, and include proper logging where applicable. Itâ€™s important that significant functionality is unit-tested. While not everything needs coverage, particularly complex areas involving the graphics engine, core features should have tests to ensure stability. If you get stuck or need guidance, donâ€™t hesitate to ask for helpâ€”collaboration is key to moving the project forward. I welcome everyoneâ€™s unique skills and backgrounds, but please be aware that prior experience in your applicable skills is expected.

Beyond coding, skills in graphic design, sound, modeling, UI, and other creative areas are also valuable to the project. Any contribution, whether technical or creative, is welcome and considered. Everyoneâ€™s work, ideas, and vision will be respected, and any form of discrimination or disrespect just wonâ€™t be toleratedâ€”weâ€™re here to create something fun together.

If youâ€™d like to contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with a brief description of your work. Iâ€™ll review contributions when I get the chance.

Thank you for your timeâ€”it's valuable.
