# Contribute

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. This is a personal project that I work on in my free time. While I plan to make regular progress, the focus is more on enjoying the process rather than rapid development.

There‚Äôs a lot of work ahead, from developing gameplay mechanics to building systems from scratch. I have a vision for where the project is headed, but I'm definitely open to other people's ideas and creativity. Ultimately, where this project ends up will be decided by what‚Äôs the most fun. That said, it‚Äôs important to keep the overall vision in mind as we move forward. You can find the detailed project vision in the [vision.md](meta/vision.md) file located in the `meta` directory.

I appreciate any contributions, whether it's code, ideas, or feedback. Good communication will be key as we work together, especially as the project evolves. If you have questions or ideas, feel free to reach out via [Discord](https://discord.gg/dzFgPC4U) or email (you can find the email by running `git log --reverse --format="%an <%ae>" | head -n 1` in this repo).

When contributing code, please follow standard practices like PEP 8, use strict typing, and include proper logging where applicable. It‚Äôs important that significant functionality is unit-tested. While not everything needs coverage, particularly complex areas involving the graphics engine, core features should have tests to ensure stability. If you get stuck or need guidance, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help‚Äîcollaboration is key to moving the project forward. I welcome everyone‚Äôs unique skills and backgrounds, but please be aware that prior experience in your applicable skills is expected.

Beyond coding, skills in graphic design, sound, modeling, UI, and other creative areas are also valuable to the project. Any contribution, whether technical or creative, is welcome and appreciated. Everyone‚Äôs work, ideas, and vision will be respected, and any form of discrimination or disrespect will not be tolerated‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to create something fun together.

If you‚Äôd like to contribute, fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request with a brief description of your work. I‚Äôll review contributions when I get the chance.

## Branching

At the moment, we are working with a working master model where the main branch is volatile until a basic release is made (v0.2.0). At that point, we will switch over to a more tested DTAP-compatible model of branching. For now, it's Main -> `[TASK/BUGFIX/DOCU]/[name]/[ticket_num]-[small description]`, for example, `TASK/Scarlett/-implement graphics system`. Please note the `-` before the description; this is because there are no ticket numbers at the moment.

After this, please just make a merge request to `main` or after `>v0.2.0` to `development`. From there, it will be merged to acceptance -> staging -> main. Most of these stages will be hollow in the beginning, but it‚Äôs good to maintain structure.

## Commit Naming

For commit naming, I am using [semantic-versioning](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji), mostly because it allows us to quickly see what type of work was done where. I also like the neutral tense tone it recommends.

This is implemented in a custom check in the semantic-versioning. Please follow the standard, or create an MR where you have squashed your commits‚ÄîI can give them a good name if you prefer.

### Examples

- **Feature**: `:sparkles: feat: add user authentication module`
- **Bugfix**: `:bug: fix: resolve crash on login screen`
- **Documentation**: `:memo: docs: update README with setup instructions`

These examples showcase how to format commit messages for different types of changes:

- **Feature**: Use `:sparkles:` (‚ú®) for new features.
- **Bugfix**: Use `:bug:` (üêõ) for bug fixes.
- **Documentation**: Use `:memo:` (üìù) for documentation updates.

These conventions help in quickly identifying the nature of changes in the commit history.
For the whole list you can go to gitmoji or install the gitmoji plugin in your IDE to just type for it to match the right one.
